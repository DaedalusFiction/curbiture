#### Honey Bun

Three days now gone in sugar fast,
No sweet unnatural has touched
My lips or tongue. And I will last
Until my victory is clutched.

For I to me have made a vow:
No processed foods will I consume
No syrup-saturated chow
Will occupy my dining room

Until the season blooms anew,
When sun’s light shines and guns come out,
The only treats that I’ll go through
Are almond nut and brussel sprout.

And so I stand with cart in hand
My basket filled with low-carb snacks,
When Fate attacks, and all I’d planned
Is cleaved as with a battle-ax--

For there beside the aisle divide
A lonely honey bun at rest;
And in that instant I decide
To scotch my dietary quest.

For I cannot resist the swirl
Of sticky sugars stuffed inside
The flaky bread baked in a curl
Where pleasures unsurpassed reside.

And so, with head held low, I see
Upon the slowly turning sheet,
The emblem of my frailty
The symbol of my quick defeat.

#### Ding Dong

Who’s there? I hear a shuffling
I wonder if my mother’s home
For she had promised sweetened things
Like Apple Jacks and Honeycomb.

Alas! Tis only th’mailman’s knock
To signify his duty filled.
Again, the ringing of the clock,
It leaves me feeling quite un-thrilled.

What’s this? Between the cushions here
I feel a crumply, crumbly puck–
Oh could it be? Oh, yes! I’m free
From hours of abysmal luck!

O praise the Gods! Who heard my plight
And softened to my poverished state!
They’ve sent a viand to alight
My hungering, my breast to sate.

Unable to control my yen
I skip on through formality
And bite into the biscuit, when
I spit out with profanity:

O treachery of treacheries!
The cream inside is curdled through!
It has the texture of a cheese
And smells of chicken cordon bleu.

Oh mother, save me from my gut
And calm me with your gentle ways;
I promise that I'll never shut
You out, and keep you all my days.
